_____________________________________________________________
This project conaint same faile each file conatin same information,and this website run 
but performance of this website so bad and need to optimaze this website bay the same way.

A way I used to optimaze website is:-

1-minify html and css 
2-inline css, write css in html
3-used async to script tag
4-compression image
5-used media quere and print
6-remove codes that not necsary
7-remove file that not need to reduce critecal resorcis
8-removed google fonts link
9-Resize images

Performance website before optimazation in mobile is 27 and desctop 28
when optimazation accure performance in mobile is 92 and desctop 94.

#This project conatin file view in this file have foldaer image and js and file pizza,
and commpresion image to reduce size then incrase performance,
folder js contain file (main.js) used to updateposition of pizza nad change size pizza and samething,

#fix changesize by using (swith) and using (%) inside (for) to change size.
